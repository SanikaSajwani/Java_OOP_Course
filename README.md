### 📝 Assignment Task 1: VideoTape Class
A VideoTape class that follows OOP principles with private data members, constructors, and methods for:
- Initiating and managing video attributes like Title, Duration, Size, Resolution, Created date, and Classification (Comedy, Drama, or Talk Show).
- Implementing getter and setter methods.
- Handling invalid classifications using setClassification().
- Demonstrating object creation and copying.

### 📝 Assignment Task 2: LengthDetail & Trapezium Classes
LengthDetail (superclass) with length and width (float).
- Constructors: Default (-1), Parameterized, Copy.
- Method: perimeter_shape() (calculates perimeter).

Trapezium (subclass) extends LengthDetail, adding a and b.
- Uses super for constructor calls.
- Method: total_length() (calls perimeter_shape() using super).

Main Class
- Creates three objects (Obj1, Obj2, Obj3 using different types of constructors).
- Calls methods to compute perimeters and prints results.
